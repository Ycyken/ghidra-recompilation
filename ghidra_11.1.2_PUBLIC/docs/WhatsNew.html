<H1>Ghidra: NSA Reverse Engineering Software</H2>

    <P>
    Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by NSA's Research Directorate.
    This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable
    users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
    Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, debugging, emulation, graphing, and scripting, along with
    hundreds of other features.  Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and 
    executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes.  Users may also
    develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using the exposed API.  In addition there are
    numerous ways to extend Ghidra such as new processors, loaders/exporters, automated analyzers,
    and new visualizations.
    </P>
    
    <P>
    In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems
    on complex SRE efforts and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform.  NSA
    has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious
    code and generating deep insights for NSA analysts who seek a better understanding of potential
    vulnerabilities in networks and systems.
    </P>
    <hr>   
        
    <H1>What's New in Ghidra 11.1</H1>
    
    <H2>The not-so-fine print: Please Read!</H2>
    
    <P>This release includes new features, enhancements, performance improvements, quite a few bug fixes, and many pull-request
	contributions. Thanks to all those who have contributed their time, thoughts, and code. The Ghidra user community thanks you too!</P>

	<P>Ghidra 11.x is fully backward compatible with project data from previous releases.
	However, programs and data type archives which are created or modified in 11.x will not be usable by an earlier Ghidra version. </P>

	<P>This distribution requires at minimum JDK 17 to run, but can also run under JDK 21.</P>

	<P>NOTE: Each build distribution will include native components (e.g., decompiler) for at least one platform (e.g., Windows x86-64).
	If you have another platform that is not included in the build distribution, you can build
	native components for your platform directly from the distribution.
	See the <a href="InstallationGuide.html">Ghidra Installation Guide</a> for additional information.
	Users running with older shared libraries and operating systems (e.g., CentOS 7.x) may also run into 
	compatibility errors when launching native executables such as the Decompiler and GNU Demangler which 
	may necessitate a rebuild of native components.</P>
		
	<P>IMPORTANT: To use the Debugger, you will need Python3 (3.7 to 3.12 supported) installed on your system.</P>

	<P>NOTE: Ghidra Server: The Ghidra 11.x server is compatible with Ghidra 9.2 and later Ghidra clients.  Ghidra 11.x
	clients are compatible with all 10.x and 9.x servers.  Although, due to potential Java version differences, it is recommended
	that Ghidra Server installations older than 10.2 be upgraded.  Those using 10.2 and newer should not need a server upgrade.</P>
	
	<P>NOTE: Any programs imported with a Ghidra beta version or code built directly from source code outside of a release tag may not be compatible,
	and may have flaws that won't be corrected by using this new release.  Any programs analyzed from a beta or other local master source build should be considered
	experimental and re-imported and analyzed with a release version.</P>
	
	<P>Programs imported with previous release versions should upgrade correctly through various
	automatic upgrade mechanisms.  However, there may be improvements or bug fixes in the import and analysis process that will provide better results than prior
	Ghidra versions.  You might consider comparing a fresh import of any program you will continue to reverse engineer to see if the latest Ghidra
	provides better results.</P>

	<H2>Debugger </H2>

    <P><span class="gtitle">ATTENTION:</span> Please delete and re-import the default Debugger tool!</P>
    
    <P> We are introducing a new debugger connection system called Trace RMI. This is replacing the older system,
    which we are calling the Recorder system.</P>
    
    <P>The most noticeable difference will be a new menu for launching targets. It is very similar to the previous system, but with some key differences:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
       <LI>Connection and launching are no longer separated into two different configuration panels. There is one panel to launch your target.</LI>
       <LI>Ghidra will no longer attempt to launch blindly with defaults. The first time you launch a program, you must select a launcher and configure it.</LI>
       <LI>After the initial launch you can re-launch with a previous configuration, without requiring a prompt.</LI>
    </UL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P>The next most noticeable difference will be the replacement of the Interpreter window with the Terminal window. This is a proper VT-100
    terminal emulator, so the experience will be much like, if not identical to, how you'd debug in a plain terminal, except embedded into and integrated with Ghidra.
    Some notable improvements that brings:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
        <LI>Tab completion, history, etc., should all work as implemented by the connected debugger's command-line interface.</LI>
        <LI>When the target is running, it has proper I/O in that terminal.</LI>
        <LI>If connecting goes poorly for some reason, the debugger's command-line interface is likely still operational.</LI>
    </UL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P>You may also notice the replacement of the Debugger Targets window with the Connection Manager window, and the replacement
    of the Objects window with the Model window. These are operationally very similar to their previous counterparts.</P>

    <P><span class="gtitle">For Power Users:</span> The launchers are just shell scripts on Linux and macOS, and batch files on Windows. We have provided plugins
    for integrating with GDB, LLDB, and the Windows Debugger. So long as your target works with one of these debuggers, orchestrating
    another kind of target is mostly a matter of creating a new shell script. This is usually accomplished by using the most similar
    one as a template and then trying it out in Ghidra. When errors occur, Ghidra will inform you of what progress it made before it
    failed, and the Terminal should display any error messages produced by your script.</P>

    <P><span class="gtitle">For Developers:</span> Developers may notice that debugger integration is now all done using Python 3.
    We have specified a new protocol we call Trace RMI, which provides client access to Ghidra's trace databases over TCP.
    It uses protobuf and is substantially simpler than the previous GADP protocol. We have provided the client implementation in
    Python 3. Existing integrations can be fairly easily extended, if necessary. For example, see the support for Wine we included in our GDB plugin.</P>

    <P>If you wish to integrate a completely new debugger, and it has a Python 3 API, then things are relatively straightforward, so long as
    the debugger provides the events and information that Ghidra expects. Use an existing plugin as a template or reference and have fun.
    If the new debugger does not have Python 3 bindings, the protobuf specification is available, so the client can be ported, if necessary.</P>

    <P><span class="gtitle">IMPORTANT:</span> To use the new Trace RMI system, you will need Python3 (3.7 to 3.12 supported) installed on your system.
    Additional setup may be required for each type of debug connection. Press <span class="gtitle">F1</span> in the debug connector's launch dialog
    for more information.</P>
    
    <P>Overall, we believe this a substantially more approachable system than our previous DebuggerObjectModel SPI used in the Recorder system.</P>
	
	
    <H2>GhidraGo </H2>
	
	<P>GhidraGo is an experimental feature that adds integration support for Ghidra URL's and Ghidra Tools. GhidraGO can now process GhidraURL's that
	locate folders within a project instead of only programs. For example a remote GhidraURL locating a project folder will open a read only view of
	the repository in the front end tool and select the folder from the URL. If the GhidraURL refers to a folder in the currently open
	active project, then the folder is selected within the active project's view instead of a read only view.
	</P>
	
	<H2>PDB </H2>
	<P>The PDB data type processing changes from release 11.0 have been further enhanced, simplifying the processing model and reducing the number of datatype
	conflicts.  The algorithm for choosing the primary symbol at an address has been improved to provide the richest possible information.  The PDB Universal
	Analyzer has been split into multiple analyzers so that PDB function processing can follow interim analyzers that specialize in finding code.
	Lastly, the Load PDB Task has been improved to schedule appropriate follow-on analyzers that are selected in the Analysis Options.</P>
	
	<H2>Version Tracking </H2>
	
	<P> Version Tracking Session files may now be added to a shared project repository.  Once a version tracking file has been checked in to a project,
	it must be checked out for exclusive access. For more information, see help found in the Version Tracking's
	Session Wizard help for more information.</P>

    <P>NOTE:  Prior to adding a pre-existing VT Session to a shared project repository, it is highly recommended that it first be re-opened
    and saved.  This will upgrade the VT Session internal version to prevent its use with older versions of Ghidra which will not respect
    the exclusive checkout requirement.</P>
	
	<H2>Mach-O Improvements</H2>
    <P>Mach-O support continues to improve, adding support for new features as well as filling in some gaps that existed for several years.
    The latest dyld_shared_cache files use a new format for pointer fixups, which Ghidra now supports.  A new GFileSystem has also been
    implemented to import and/or extract individual Mach-O binaries from Mach-O "file sets" (i.e., kernelcache).  A second new GFileSystem
    has been added which can extract Apple LZFSE-compressed files.  Other improvements have also been made to provide more complete markup of Mach-O load commands.</P>
    
    <H2>Swift </H2>
    <P>Initial support for binaries written in the Swift Programming Language has been added.  The new support relies on the native Swift demangler being
    present on the user's system.  Swift is automatically bundled with XCode on macOS, and can be optionally installed on Windows and Linux. 
    See the "Demangler Swift" analyzer options for more information.  Type information gathered from the demangled Swift symbol names is used to
    create corresponding Ghidra data types.  This currently works for Swift primitives and structures, but more work needs to be done to include
    classes and other advanced data types.  Swift-specific calling conventions are also applied to demangled Swift functions.</P>
    
    <H2>Usability </H2>
    
    <P>There have been many improvements to keyboard only actions and navigation in Ghidra. These changes will be welcome for those who
    prefer to use the keyboard as much as possible and those needing better accessibility.  Improvements include:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
       <LI>Standard keyboard navigation should now work in most component windows and dialogs. In general, <span class="gtitle">Tab</span> and <span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt; Tab</span> will
       move focus to the next focusable component and <span class="gtitle">&lt;SHIFT&gt; Tab</span> and <span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt; Tab</span> will move to the
       previous focusable component. <span class="gtitle">Tab</span> and <span class="gtitle">&lt;SHIFT&gt; Tab</span> do not always work as some components use those keys internally, but
       <span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt; Tab,</span> and <span class="gtitle">&lt;SHIFT&gt;&lt;CTRL&gt; Tab</span> should work universally.</LI>
       <LI>Ghidra now provides some convenient keyboard shortcut actions for transferring focus:</LI>
       <UL>
        <LI><span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt; F3</span> - Transfers focus to  the next window or dialog.</LI>
        <LI><span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt; F3</span> - Transfers focus to the previous window or dialog.</LI>
        <LI><span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt; J</span> - Transfers focus to the next titled dockable component (titled windows).</LI>
        <LI><span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;SHIFT&gt; J</span> - Transfers focus to the previous titled dockable component.</LI>
       </UL>
       <LI>All actions can now be accessed via a searchable dialog.</LI>
       <UL>
        <LI>Pressing <span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt; 3</span> will bring up the actions dialog with the local toolbar, popup and keyboard actions.</LI>
        <LI>Pressing <span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt; 3</span> a second time will add in all the global actions. </LI>
        <LI>Pressing <span class="gtitle">&lt;CTRL&gt; 3</span> a third time will add in the disabled actions as well.</LI>
        <LI>The actions dialog was specifically designed to be easy to use without a mouse. Typing will filter the actions list and the
        arrow keys allow you to select an action and enter will invoke the selected action </LI>
       </UL>
    </UL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

	<H2>Other Improvements </H2>
	
	<P>Support for the <span class="gtitle">SquashFS</span> filesystem has been added.</P>
	
	<P>A new wildcard assembler API has been added that can generate all possible variants of an instruction with a variety of wildcards for operands.
    Two new scripts, <span class="gtitle">FindInstructionWithWildcard</span> and <span class="gtitle">WildSleighAssemblerInfo</span>, demonstrate how to use the API.
    For more information, see help and search for <span class="gtitle">Wildcard Assembler</span>.
	
	<P>A new <span class="gtitle">Runtime Information</span> dialog has replaced the Show VM Memory dialog.  The dialog contains more information
	which can aid in debugging, including version information, classpath, defined properties, environment variables, and more.</P>
	
	<P>The GhidraDev Eclipse plugin has a new wizard for importing an existing Ghidra module source directory. This will work best with Ghidra module projects
	created against Ghidra 11.1 or later.</P>
	
	<P>Finding references to fields within a structure has been greatly improved.  Previously many references to the field would be missed if they occurred within
	functions calling external functions using the structure, or when the field was used only in local variables dynamically generated by
	the decompiler.</P>
	
	<P>Golang versions 17 thru 22 are now supported.</P>
	
	<P>DWARF5 debug format is now supported.  In addition, DWARF line number information processing has been incorporated into the base DWARF analyzer and the
	separate DWARF line number analyzer has been removed.</P>
		
    <H2>Additional Bug Fixes and Enhancements</H2>
    <P> Numerous other new features, improvements, and bug fixes are fully listed in the <a href="ChangeHistory.html">ChangeHistory</a> file.</P>
